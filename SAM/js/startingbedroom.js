var mainText = 'Sam wakes up with an unusual headache. She remembers the last time she had this kind of pain was the morning when she had woken up from one too many drinks at a graduation party in college. But that is not the strangest thing she notices about this morning. Everything is different: different ceiling, different bed, even the air smells a bit off. It smells like... some animal; she is not quite sure. Sam notices her smartphone is where she would normally place it before she goes to sleep, on the bedside cabinet right beside her pillows. Maybe she is misplaced herself into someone else s house. After all, she does feel this headache that brings regrettable memories along with it. She picks the phone up before looking out a tiny window by the bed. There is nothing outside that she recognizes, just endless blades of grass waving along in the wind. There is a door across from the bed. It does not look like a door that leads to the outside; nonetheless, Sam sincerely hopes that the door better not be locked.';
