<h2>Design</h2>
<p>We design the javascript part to be object-oriented. Every raw text and options are converted into objects when the game starts. The expansions we planned for our final projects are pronoun designation, sound and image illustrations, mini-puzzle games, and inventory system integration.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>The main challenge of this section of the project was debugging. Because our javascript file has become substantially large, it is quite hard to track where does a bug suddenly come from especially without the help of a version control tool such as github.</p>
<p>There was also challenges regarding event listeners via jQuery, I personally spent countless ours on trying to get some parameters passed into a call back function dynamically, and fortunately succeeded in doing so after dozens of Google searches.</p>
